This file is updated every time the init file is reloaded, so the
entire configuration (aside from the bootstrapping code) should
document itself here. If you don't often reload Emacs, you can update
the documentation with =M-x reload-user-init-file=.

* Emacs Configuration in an Org file
  I've declared Emacs config bankruptcy (again!). In the interest of a
  wacky refresh, might as well just start from scratch. =req-package=,
  =Cask=, and =pallet= don't quite fit my needs, anymore, so this'll
  be a fairly straightforward =quelpa= and =use-package= affair.

* Keep Custom Out of Version Control
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq custom-file "~/.emacs.d/custom.el")
    (load custom-file)
  #+END_SRC

* Package Management

** Initialize Quelpa (auto-upgrade snippet)
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (package-initialize)
    (if (require 'quelpa nil t)
        (quelpa-self-upgrade)
      (with-temp-buffer
        (url-insert-file-contents "https://raw.github.com/quelpa/quelpa/master/bootstrap.el")
        (eval-buffer)))
  #+END_SRC

** Install =quelpa-use-package=
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (quelpa
      '(quelpa-use-package
        :fetcher github
        :repo "quelpa/quelpa-use-package"))
     (require 'quelpa-use-package)
   #+END_SRC


* Core Configuration
  First, I need to undo a series of exceptionally terrible defaults
  that Emacs insists upon, and set up basic ergonomy. We'll get some
  convenient modernisms set up, as well.
