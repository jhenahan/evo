* Performance Tweaks
  By default, Emacs garbage collects after consing 800k bytes (not
  800KB). We'll bump it up to 100MB so we don't have to do that so
  much. Memory is cheap.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq gc-cons-threshold (* 100 1024 1024))
  #+END_SRC

  We can also set font-locking to occur in the background, which helps
  when fontifying large buffers. =jit-lock-defer-time= and
  =jit-lock-stealth-verbose= are =nil= by default, but it doesn't hurt
  to be explicit.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package jit-lock
      :init
      (setq jit-lock-defer-time nil
	    jit-lock-stealth-nice 0.1
	    jit-lock-stealth-time 0.2
	    jit-lock-stealth-verbose nil))
  #+END_SRC

  This isn't strictly a performance setting, but computers have come a
  long way, and I don't need Emacs complaining about a biggish
  file. 25MB should be a fine limit.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package files
      :init
      (setq large-file-warning-threshold (* 25 1024 1024)))
  #+END_SRC
