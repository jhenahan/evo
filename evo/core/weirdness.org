* Undoing Weird Emacs Defaults
** Sentences should end with a single space
   Welcome to {{{time(%Y)}}}.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq sentence-end-double-space nil)
   #+END_SRC

** Whitespace must be purged
   I can't think of scenario in which I wanted extraneous whitespace,
   so let's just destroy it.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (use-package whitespace
       :init
       (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'whitespace-cleanup))
   #+END_SRC
