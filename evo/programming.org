* Programming
  #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/evo/programming/languages.org"
* Debugging
  We set [[https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/][=gdb=]] up as a mutlti-windowed debugger.
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq gdb-many-windows t
          gdb-show-main t)
  #+END_SRC
* Diffing
  [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ediff/][=ediff=]] is my diff and merge tool of choice, and I prefer the diff to be
  displayed in a single window, rather than in multiple frames.
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq ediff-window-setup-function 'ediff-setup-windows-plain)
  #+END_SRC

* Tramp
  I just started getting the hang of [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode][Tramp]] for remote editing, and I've found
  the experience quite gratifying. I do everything over SSH, so we'll inform
  Tramp that we really want that by default.
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq tramp-default-method "ssh"
          tramp-backup-directory-alist backup-directory-alist
          tramp-ssh-controlmaster-options "ssh")
  #+END_SRC
